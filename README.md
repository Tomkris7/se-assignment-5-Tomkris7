Pushing Changes to GitHub

1. Add Remote Repository:
- If you haven’t already added a remote repository, you’ll need to do so.
- Go to the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) and type `Git: Add Remote`.
- Select `Git: Add Remote` and provide a name for the remote (e.g., `origin`), then enter the URL of your GitHub repository.

2. Push Changes:
- After adding the remote, you can push your commits.
- Click on the ellipsis (`...`) in the Source Control view and select `Push`, or use the Command Palette and type `Git: Push`.
- If this is the first time pushing to this remote, you might be prompted to set the upstream branch. Confirm by selecting the appropriate option.
